/**
 * CON2A4_Exp.java
 * 
 * This program demonstrates two-way selection using if-else statements.
 * Knowledge Point: CON-2.A.4 - A two-way selection is written when there are two sets of statementsâ€”
 * one to be executed when the Boolean condition is true, and another set for when the Boolean condition is false.
 * In this case, the body of the "if" is executed when the Boolean condition is true, and the body of the "else"
 * is executed when the Boolean condition is false.
